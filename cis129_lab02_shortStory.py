print('There once was a small hamster who enjoyed cheese.')
print('One day, the hamster traveled into the kitchen to look for some cheese as an afternoon snack.')
print('The hamster was happy to find a huge chunk of cheese just sitting around in the open.')
print('Unfortunately, the cheese was attached to a rat trap for the pests plaguing the house.')
print('There was a quick SNAP! and just like that the hamster was unfortunately gone for gouda.')
